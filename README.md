# Marble - Proto-Reinforcement Learning problem

## Motivation
The main motivation is understand the Standard Model of Reinforcement Algorithm, 
identify the different elements and try a proto-RL algorithm.

You can find an explanation for this Project in my article in Medium: [Proto-Reinforcement Learning (spanish)](https://link.medium.com/RRIVDTKmb2)

**Objective**
+ There is a marbles basket that we have to fill with BASKET_SIZE number of marbles.

**Definition**
+ We have a number (PUMPER NUMBER) of pumpers, from where an unknown number of marbles fall into the basket. There is some logic in the number that an intelligent algorithm could discover.

This is a quite easy problem for a human, could a **proto-Reinforcement Learning** algorithm fill the basket with the minimum number of steps?


## Version

v1.0.0 First version

## Python

Python 3.7

The script was initially developed in a Google Colab Notebook.
It has been ported to a standard series of Python scripts.

## Usage

1. Create a Virtual Environment and import the dependencies
2. Execute main.py

## Test
This project does not include tests.
