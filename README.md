# Marble - Proto-Reinforcement Learning problem

**Objective**
+ There is a marbles basket that we have to fill with BASKET_SIZE number of marbles.

**Definition**
+ We have a number (PUMPER NUMBER) of pumpers, from where an unknown number of marbles fall into the basket. There is some logic in the number that an intelligent algorithm could discover.

This is a quite easy problem for a human, could a **proto-Reinforcement Learning** algorithm fill the basket with the minimum number of steps?
